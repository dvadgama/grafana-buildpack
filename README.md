## **Custom Config Files**
- **runtime.txt**: User can specify the version of Grafana that needs to be installed , current default version is 6.3.5

- **grafana.ini**: With this file , user can override the default configuration

## Todo
- Validate downloaded file with checksum
- make it work with mysql, currently Grafana seems to have trouble with useSSL=True in mysql URI and, suggested work around is to use ClOUD SQL PROXY , which is something needs to be done if need arises
